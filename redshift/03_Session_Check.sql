-- If queries in multiple sessions hold locks on the same table, you can use PG_TERMINATE_BACKEND to terminate one of the sessions, which forces any currently running transactions in the terminated session to release all locks and roll back the transaction. Query the STV_LOCKS system table to view currently held locks.

-- If a query is not in a transaction block (BEGIN â€¦ END), you can cancel the query by using the CANCEL command or the PG_CANCEL_BACKEND function.
