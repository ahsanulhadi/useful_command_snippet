Missing Statistics: Run ANALYZE following data loads or significant updates and use STATUPDATE with COPY operations. For more information, see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_designing-queries-best-practices.html

Nested Loop: Nested loop is usually a Cartesian product. Evaluate query to ensure that all participating tables are joined efficiently.

Very Selective Filter: The ratio of rows returned to rows scanned is less than 0.05. Rows scanned is the value of rows_pre_user_filter and rows returned is the value of rows in the STL_SCAN system table. 
Indicates that the query is scanning an unusually large number of rows to determine the result set. This can be caused by missing or incorrect sort keys. For more information, see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Sorting_data.html

Excessive Ghost Rows: A scan skipped a relatively large number of rows that are marked as deleted but not vacuumed, or rows that have been inserted but not committed. For more information, see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Reclaiming_storage_space202.html

Large Distribution: More than 1,000,000 rows were redistributed for hash join or aggregation. For more information, see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Distributing_data.html

Large Broadcast: More than 1,000,000 rows were broadcast for hash join. For more information, see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Distributing_data.html

Serial Execution: A DS_DIST_ALL_INNER redistribution style was indicated in the query plan, which forces serial execution because the entire inner table was redistributed to a single node. For more information, see Choosing a Data Distribution Style.
