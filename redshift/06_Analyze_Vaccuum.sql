/*
DATA SKEW: Key Distribution Style and Skew ->>

Skew is a critical factor related to a distribution style of KEY. Skew measures the ratio between the fewest and greatest number of rows on a compute node in the cluster. A high skew indicates that you have many more rows on one (or more) of the compute nodes compared to the other nodes. Skew results in performance hotspots and negates the benefits of distributing data for node-local joins. Check your assumptions with skew; sometimes you think a column provides good distribution but in reality it does not. A common occurrence is when you donâ€™t realize that a column is nullable, resulting in rows with null placed on one compute node. If no column provides relatively even data distribution using a KEY distribution style, then choose a style of EVEN. For examples of checking skew, see the tuning reference below.

If you need to use a style of EVEN for some of your tables, then try to form your queries to join these tables as late as possible. This results in a smaller data set, when you apply the join to the evenly distributed table, and improves performance.

The query engine is able to use sort order to efficiently select which data blocks need to be scanned to process a query. For an interleaved sort, Amazon Redshift analyzes the sort key column values to determine the optimal sort order. If the distribution of key values changes, or skews, as rows are added, the sort strategy will no longer be optimal, and the performance benefit of sorting will degrade. To reanalyze the sort key distribution you can run a VACUUM REINDEX. The reindex operation is time consuming, so to decide whether a table will benefit from a reindex, query the SVV_INTERLEAVED_COLUMNS view.

create table likecalendardays (like calendardays);

drop table calendardays;
alter table likecalendardays rename to calendardays;
-- ----------------
Performing a deep copy using CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) is faster than using CREATE TABLE LIKE, but CTAS does not preserve the sort key, encoding, distkey, and notnull attributes of the parent table. For a comparison of different deep copy methods,
